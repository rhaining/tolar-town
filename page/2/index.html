<p>Earlier in the day, I stopped by my artwork to discover only half of it had been painted over in its first 24 hours of life, which I was pretty happy about! (I mostly expected it to be completely gone by then.)</p>

                <div class="post-content"><p>I went on a walking tour of street art in Melbourne that I found on <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/experiences/151845?s=67&amp;shared_item_type=2&amp;virality_entry_point=2&amp;sharer_id=2250468">Airbnb</a>. Lukas took me and another guest around to see some cool street art, pointed out various different styles, and put it all into context and the culture around the street art scene here. BUT, the highlight is that we got to make our own street art. It was awesome! I was super nervous to start, but it came out way better than I had hoped.</p>

<p>I chose to paint Ignignokt, a mooninite from the tv show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Aqua_Teen_Hunger_Force_characters#Ignignokt_and_Err">Aqua Teen Hunger Force</a> (ATHF). Not only is ATHF made by [adult swim] in Atlanta, but the voice actor for Ignignokt is ATHF creator Dave Willis, who went to Wake Forest and while there was Station Manager at Wake Radio (two things I also did). Also, my late friend Trey Tims worked at Adult Swim and worked on the marketing campaign that put LED-based mooninites up in 10 different US cities, most notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Boston_Mooninite_panic">Boston</a> (sigh, lol).</p>

You can catch a couple of them inside the rocks during the day, but the real treat is right at sunset, when they swim up to the shore and waddle up to the rocks. PENGUINS!!!</p>

<p>We stopped by their house for a bit before Taylor &amp; I went to dinner at Supernormal, which turned out to be my best meal in Melbourne (so far at least!). We started with cocktails and the raw Kingfish with mandarin dashi, arame. It was a good start to what would continue to be a great meal. We moved on to the Crisp pork jowl &amp; watercress salad – that pork jowl was not only crisp, but so tender it was like liquid pork. The New England lobster roll was perhaps the perfect form of a lobster roll – a lobster salad ensconced in a brioche roll with a fantastic light crunch. For the main, we had the slow-cooked Szechuan lamb with sesame bread &amp; coriander paste. The spice was subtle and never over-powering, but the lamb was so tender and flavorful!</p>

<p><img src="/posts/2019/11/09/charcoal-lane/negroni.jpg" alt="Negroni" />
<em>I started with a negroni: Native pepperberry infused gin, Antica Formula, Campari. I couldn&rsquo;t quite detect any significant pepperberry flavor, but it was still delicious.</em>

<em>To start, I enjoyed the charred asparagus + legume medley, with desert lime preserve, white onion + eucalypt cream, basil + pepperberry oil, chia seed crumb.</em>
<br/><br/></p>

<p><img src="/posts/2019/11/09/charcoal-lane/kangaroo.jpg" alt="Kangaroo" />
<em>For my main, I chowed down on the chargrilled kangaroo sirloin, with parsnip, carrot + beetroot timbale, seared bok choy, davidson plum sauce. It was my first taste of kangaroo, which was a leaner and slightly gamier than beef. They recommend not going past rare or medium rare as it&rsquo;s so lean. Overall, I loved the meat with the plum sauce, though I added a bit of salt to it. The parsnip was delightful too! So delicate. I paired this dish with the Innocent Bystander Syrah 2017 from Yarra Valley, Victoria (closeby to Melbourne).</em>

If it wasn&rsquo;t raining, I would have stopped to take some photos. I did stop at Kennett River where koalas are known to live. I followed some tourists up a hill, and after staring up at a tree where others were staring, I finally spotted the koala!</p>

I walked around a bit in Fitzroy and had a mid-afternoon visit to the Victorian House of Parliament, which was pretty neat. I got to see where Queen Elizabeth sat to open Parliament back in 1954!</p>

<p>I had a delicious dinner of dumplings &amp; chicken at Hutong Dumpling House and a couple of cocktails at Bar Americano and Over Board, which were dope.</p>
