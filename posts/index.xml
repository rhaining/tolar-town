      <description>My first full day in Seoul! I had a good breakfast at Bimbam Cafe near the hotel, then walked down to the War Memorial of Korea, which encompassed lots of history of Korea, with an emphasis on the Korean War.
I had a yummy sandwich at Casablanca in Itaewon, then met up with Tiffany &amp;amp; fam to see the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Arario museum.
We had a dope Korean dinner of seafood &amp;amp; veggie pancake, a spicy salad with chestnut jelly, and a creamy noodle soup, along with makgeolli, a Korean rice wine that was yum.</description>

      <description>After a long flight from Melbourne with a middle-of-the-night layover in Singapore, I made it to Seoul! I took the KAL (Korean Airlines) Limousine Bus from Seoul&amp;rsquo;s Incheon airport to the Grand Hyatt hotel. The bus was pretty nice, as it does a loop from the airport to major hotels in Seoul, so it&amp;rsquo;s a easy, inexpensive way to efficiently get to the destination.
I was pretty wiped out when I checked in, but I managed to walk down to Full Moon where I had a beef bulgogi meal, complete with various Korean style sides.</description>

      <description>For the past four weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Australia, mostly staying in Melbourne, but also Torquay and Hobart (Tasmania). It&amp;rsquo;s been amazing! I&amp;rsquo;ve been blown away by how nice of a city is, let alone the fantastic food, coffee, &amp;amp; drinks available nearly everywhere.

      <description>Just a few blocks from where I&amp;rsquo;m staying, I happened upon a multi-block street festival that had two stages of various music &amp;amp; dancing, and in between a menagerie of food options. I ended up getting some chicken &amp;lsquo;wanton&amp;rsquo; tacos, which were pretty tasty.</description>

      <description>Today, Taylor &amp;amp; I went to Mate Fest, an international beer fest hosted by Moon Dog Brewery in Melbourne. Our friend Erik from Magpie in Seoul gave a masterclass, which was pretty fun!

      <description>A mostly random sort of day with Erik and Taylor. We ate and drank our way around Melbourne.
Soft shelled crab &amp;lsquo;burger&amp;rsquo;, from Proud Mary&amp;rsquo;s. (basically, they seem to call anything on a bun a &amp;lsquo;burger&amp;rsquo;) 
Tempura green beans, from Byrdi. 
Grau Projekt: an art opening that a bartender told me about, which had about 8 pieces on the wall, literal tons of salt on the floor, and maybe 9 people there.</description>

      <description>I mostly had a low-key day before meeting up with Rob and Erik for a fantastic dinner at Chin Chin, then Erik &amp;amp; I went to Mr West for some beer.
Earlier in the day, I stopped by my artwork to discover only half of it had been painted over in its first 24 hours of life, which I was pretty happy about! (I mostly expected it to be completely gone by then.</description>

      <description>I went on a walking tour of street art in Melbourne that I found on Airbnb. Lukas took me and another guest around to see some cool street art, pointed out various different styles, and put it all into context and the culture around the street art scene here. BUT, the highlight is that we got to make our own street art. It was awesome! I was super nervous to start, but it came out way better than I had hoped.</description>

      <description>This afternoon and evening, I went to St Kilda Pier in the southern part of Melbourne. Every day at sunset, a colony of penguins swims back to the rocks to sleep. You can catch a couple of them inside the rocks during the day, but the real treat is right at sunset, when they swim up to the shore and waddle up to the rocks. PENGUINS!!!

      <description>I met up with Taylor, Maki, Sheena, &amp;amp; Brenda at the South Melbourne Market, where we had coffee and pastries, walked around, did some shopping, and then had a paella lunch at Simply Spanish in the market.
We stopped by their house for a bit before Taylor &amp;amp; I went to dinner at Supernormal, which turned out to be my best meal in Melbourne (so far at least!). We started with cocktails and the raw Kingfish with mandarin dashi, arame.</description>

      <description>I stopped by Charcoal Lane tonight for dinner, which not only has delicious food and drink, but is also a &amp;ldquo;social enterprise restaurant that provides guidance and opportunity to young Aboriginal people who are in need of a fresh start in life.&amp;rdquo; So you can feel good about where your money&amp;rsquo;s going while enjoying some kangaroo!
I started with a negroni: Native pepperberry infused gin, Antica Formula, Campari. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite detect any significant pepperberry flavor, but it was still delicious.</description>

      <description>I spent the morning in Torquay with Rob. We had breakfast at Ginger Monkey, where I had a scrumptious mushroom and poached eggs on toast, and we took a tour of the Surf Museum. He went home to work, and I drove down to Anglesea to a golf club where kangaroos live. I then drove further down the Great Ocean Road, which was quite gorgeous. If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t raining, I would have stopped to take some photos.</description>

      <description>I rented (or &amp;ldquo;hired&amp;rdquo;) a car via Oyo, which is like Zipcar, but is somehow related to Toyota (get it, &amp;ldquo;Toyota&amp;rdquo;), and I drove down to Torquay, a beautiful town on the beach about a 90 minute drive from Melbourne. I saw some lovely beaches, some gorgeous rolling hills, had some good food, and experienced some mediocre fast food. Plus I got to hang out with Rob and his family!</description>

      <description>Taylor, Sheena, &amp;amp; I took a walk around the Royal Botanic Gardens in Victoria, which was gorgeous. We had a coffee at the tea room in the middle of the gardens, and later had a delightful lunch a short walk away at Denis the Menace (lol).

      <description>I had a lovely breakfast at Rustica in Fitzroy, followed by a late morning espresso at Aunty Peg&amp;rsquo;s. I walked around a bit in Fitzroy and had a mid-afternoon visit to the Victorian House of Parliament, which was pretty neat. I got to see where Queen Elizabeth sat to open Parliament back in 1954!
I had a delicious dinner of dumplings &amp;amp; chicken at Hutong Dumpling House and a couple of cocktails at Bar Americano and Over Board, which were dope.</description>

      <description>It was a slow morning due to quite a bit of ongoing rain outside. I did make it out in the morning all the way across the street to the Saturday market to buy a loaf of sourdough and a coffee (which I then had with some eggs I made at home). I finally left the house for a bit this afternoon to get some lunch and check out some shops that were on my list.</description>

      <description>For my birthday, Molly gave me a gift of a &amp;ldquo;Drinking History Tour&amp;rdquo; through Fitzroy, where I&amp;rsquo;ve been staying in Melbourne. On the evening of Halloween, I walked down to St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Cathedral to meet up with the tour. We learned some history &amp;amp; drank some drinks! It was pretty fun!

      <description>Per Harper&amp;rsquo;s recommendation, I went on the Pennicott Seafood Seduction tour today, where our fearless guides Sam &amp;amp; Hugh took us on a cruise through the waters of Hobart, Tasmania. Not only were they our guides, they were also our captains, fishermen, chefs, and entertainers â€“Â their constant prattle &amp;amp; wit back and forth kept the cruise light-hearted and fun. The day was amazing, the food top-notch, and the sights were something to behold.</description>

      <description>I started off the day with a bagel at Mile End Bagels, which was a worthwhile look at what Australian bagels are. This one was good, if not a little off from what I&amp;rsquo;m used to otherwise. I saw a little art walking around Fitzroy and Collingwood, including a Keith Haring original!
I met up with Rob and his family at the Day of the Dead festival at Flagstaff Gardens in the afternoon, before Rob and I headed off onto a walking tour to see all that Melbourne has to offer.</description>

      <description>This morning, I had a scrumptious breakfast sandwich (the &amp;ldquo;Brekkie&amp;rdquo;) at Grace Cafe near my airbnb. Food and drink continue to amaze me in Melbourne in a way I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen so consistently well done across an entire city like this before. The eggs were light and fluffy and folded into a perfectly toasted ciabatta, with chives, cheese, sriracha mayo, onion jam.
I met up with Taylor at Aunty Peg&amp;rsquo;s. We enjoyed a coffee cupping before enjoying some coffees at the bar.</description>

      <description>I had a lunch of &amp;ldquo;Dill-icious&amp;rdquo; pork dumplings and garlic cucumber salad with a homemade lemon iced tea at Shandong Mama Mini. I walked down to the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) International to see the KAWS exhibit, along with a few other things in the permanent collection, before heading to the NGV Ian Potter museum focused on Australian art.
After the walking &amp;amp; the sight-seeing, I treated myself to some cocktails at Eau de Vie in the Central Business District and Black Pearl in Fitzroy.</description>

      <description>Starting Sunday afternoon California time, I took a Lyft from Vallejo to Sacramento airport, where I endured a 5 hour delay in taking off. We made it to Los Angeles, just in time for me to sprint across two terminals and take a shuttle bus to make it for my next leg from LA to Sydney. Delta&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Premium Select&amp;rdquo; was very comfortable with a fairly large TV screen, good food &amp;amp; wine, and quality service from our flight attendants.</description>

      <description>Adam, Tara, &amp;amp; I drove from Vallejo up through the greater Sonoma region and Russian River Valley to visit a few wineries: Moshin, VJB, and Domaine Carneros. Later, Adam &amp;amp; I made a brief trip into San Francisco to attend a sound bath, complete with gongs and flutes. The wine was great, while the sound bath was a bit odd (and I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t return any time soon). But we at least got a solid hamburger in at a diner afterwards.</description>

      <description>Before leaving town, I spent the night at the new TWA Hotel at JFK airport, where I enjoyed the Sunken Bar &amp;amp; the Connie bar, which is pretty neat in that it&amp;rsquo;s inside an actual vintage airplane.
