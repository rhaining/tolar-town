      <description>I returned to Bimbam Cafe this morning, but this time got the quiche lorraine, which was even better than yesterday&amp;rsquo;s breakfast. I met up with Tiffany &amp;amp; fam to go down to the park near the Han river.
This afternoon, I took the bus up to the Jongmyo shrine, which I learned I could not enter without a tour. Unfortunately, the next one was 1Â½ hours away. So I walked up to the Bukchon Hanok village: a neighborhood of old style residential homes that are still in use.</description>

      <description>My first full day in Seoul! I had a good breakfast at Bimbam Cafe near the hotel, then walked down to the War Memorial of Korea, which encompassed lots of history of Korea, with an emphasis on the Korean War.
I had a yummy sandwich at Casablanca in Itaewon, then met up with Tiffany &amp;amp; fam to see the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Arario museum.
We had a dope Korean dinner of seafood &amp;amp; veggie pancake, a spicy salad with chestnut jelly, and a creamy noodle soup, along with makgeolli, a Korean rice wine that was yum.</description>

      <description>After a long flight from Melbourne with a middle-of-the-night layover in Singapore, I made it to Seoul! I took the KAL (Korean Airlines) Limousine Bus from Seoul&amp;rsquo;s Incheon airport to the Grand Hyatt hotel. The bus was pretty nice, as it does a loop from the airport to major hotels in Seoul, so it&amp;rsquo;s a easy, inexpensive way to efficiently get to the destination.
I was pretty wiped out when I checked in, but I managed to walk down to Full Moon where I had a beef bulgogi meal, complete with various Korean style sides.</description>
