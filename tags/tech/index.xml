      <description>Tl;dr: I built a thing. Download it.
Next week is the first debate in this season of presidential hopefuls. The frontrunner has been indicted under dozens of counts in multiple jurisdictions. We could see multiple trials and maybe even multiple convictions between now and November 2024. We certainly will see many primaries, debates, gaffes, and scandals.
