      <title>A day out shopping</title>

      <description>It was a slow morning due to quite a bit of ongoing rain outside. I did make it out in the morning all the way across the street to the Saturday market to buy a loaf of sourdough and a coffee (which I then had with some eggs I made at home). I finally left the house for a bit this afternoon to get some lunch and check out some shops that were on my list.</description>

      <description>I was wiped out from traveling back from Tasmania and doing the walking tour last night, so I laid low around the neighborhood, did some laundry, and ordered in for dinner. (And got this blog updated!)

      <description>I walked around Hobart a bit before heading back to Melbourne. Halloween isn&amp;rsquo;t huge in Australia, but I did see a few costumes … maybe?

I thought I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get my chance, but the Hobart airport came through, and I had a scallop pie for lunch!</description>

      <description>I spent a day at the Museum of Old and New Art, known as &amp;ldquo;MONA&amp;rdquo;. It was an incredible experience, starting with a delightful ferry ride from Hobart up to the museum.

      <description>Per Harper&amp;rsquo;s recommendation, I went on the Pennicott Seafood Seduction tour today, where our fearless guides Sam &amp;amp; Hugh took us on a cruise through the waters of Hobart, Tasmania. Not only were they our guides, they were also our captains, fishermen, chefs, and entertainers – their constant prattle &amp;amp; wit back and forth kept the cruise light-hearted and fun. The day was amazing, the food top-notch, and the sights were something to behold.</description>

      <description>I spent a few days in Hobart, Tasmania. This first day, I checked into the fabulous Macq Hotel, met up with Harper&amp;rsquo;s friends Joel &amp;amp; Mustafa, and drank some delicious local gin &amp;amp; whisky.

      <description>I had a wonderful breakfast at Industry Beans of Tea soaked steel cut oats, chia crumble, caramelised ginger foam, compressed watermelon, rosewater gel and fresh fruit. After, I flew to Hobart, Tasmania for a few days, which was awesome.

      <description>I started off the day with a bagel at Mile End Bagels, which was a worthwhile look at what Australian bagels are. This one was good, if not a little off from what I&amp;rsquo;m used to otherwise. I saw a little art walking around Fitzroy and Collingwood, including a Keith Haring original!
I met up with Rob and his family at the Day of the Dead festival at Flagstaff Gardens in the afternoon, before Rob and I headed off onto a walking tour to see all that Melbourne has to offer.</description>

      <description>This morning, I had a scrumptious breakfast sandwich (the &amp;ldquo;Brekkie&amp;rdquo;) at Grace Cafe near my airbnb. Food and drink continue to amaze me in Melbourne in a way I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen so consistently well done across an entire city like this before. The eggs were light and fluffy and folded into a perfectly toasted ciabatta, with chives, cheese, sriracha mayo, onion jam.
I met up with Taylor at Aunty Peg&amp;rsquo;s. We enjoyed a coffee cupping before enjoying some coffees at the bar.</description>

      <description>I had a lunch of &amp;ldquo;Dill-icious&amp;rdquo; pork dumplings and garlic cucumber salad with a homemade lemon iced tea at Shandong Mama Mini. I walked down to the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) International to see the KAWS exhibit, along with a few other things in the permanent collection, before heading to the NGV Ian Potter museum focused on Australian art.
After the walking &amp;amp; the sight-seeing, I treated myself to some cocktails at Eau de Vie in the Central Business District and Black Pearl in Fitzroy.</description>

      <description>I went to Lune Croissanteri for some pastries and coffee this morning, Brunswick Street Alimentari for lunch, and Rock Salt &amp;amp; Vinegar for dinner, before seeing some owl street art on my way home. I also survived my first trip to the grocery store today!

      <description>I walked down to Carlton and had a delicious open lamb sandwich at Seven Seeds, before continuing my walk to Hosier Lane to see my dope street art. I also met up with Taylor &amp;amp; Maki for dinner!
