      <title>The New York Easter Parade lives on!</title>

      <description>Every Easter Sunday on 5th Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, outside St Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Cathedral, there is an Easter Parade. It&amp;rsquo;s bananas. You see everything from traditional Easter bonnets to outlandish performance art projects to political statements.
This being a pandemic year, they couldn&amp;rsquo;t have the traditional gathering, so one group put together a Zoom call, complete with multiple rooms, dance parties with various styles of music, and a promenade, where folks could virtually &amp;ldquo;raise their hand&amp;rdquo; to show off their outfits.</description>

      <title>Life in New York under PAUSE</title>

      <description>It has been 4 weeks since Governor Andrew Cuomo shut down non-essential businesses in New York. He would later expand it to the New York PAUSE, similar to many other governmental policies called lockdown, shelter-in-place, and the like. The new normal has become wearing masks &amp;amp; gloves during the rare times I leave my apartment: to Foodtown, BQE Liquor &amp;amp; Wines, Meathook, or for a walk around the neighborhood, trying my best to avoid the swarms of people in parks or huddled around the newly minted takeout windows at bars &amp;amp; pizzerias.</description>

      <description>Before leaving town, I spent the night at the new TWA Hotel at JFK airport, where I enjoyed the Sunken Bar &amp;amp; the Connie bar, which is pretty neat in that it&amp;rsquo;s inside an actual vintage airplane.

      <description>Today, I had lunch at one of my favorite spots, Union Square Cafe. Beforehand, I walked past the New York City Columbus Day Parade, and took a few photos.
