      <description>This morning, I had a scrumptious breakfast sandwich (the &amp;ldquo;Brekkie&amp;rdquo;) at Grace Cafe near my airbnb. Food and drink continue to amaze me in Melbourne in a way I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen so consistently well done across an entire city like this before. The eggs were light and fluffy and folded into a perfectly toasted ciabatta, with chives, cheese, sriracha mayo, onion jam.
I met up with Taylor at Aunty Peg&amp;rsquo;s. We enjoyed a coffee cupping before enjoying some coffees at the bar.</description>

      <description>I had a lunch of &amp;ldquo;Dill-icious&amp;rdquo; pork dumplings and garlic cucumber salad with a homemade lemon iced tea at Shandong Mama Mini. I walked down to the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) International to see the KAWS exhibit, along with a few other things in the permanent collection, before heading to the NGV Ian Potter museum focused on Australian art.
After the walking &amp;amp; the sight-seeing, I treated myself to some cocktails at Eau de Vie in the Central Business District and Black Pearl in Fitzroy.</description>

      <description>I went to Lune Croissanteri for some pastries and coffee this morning, Brunswick Street Alimentari for lunch, and Rock Salt &amp;amp; Vinegar for dinner, before seeing some owl street art on my way home. I also survived my first trip to the grocery store today!

      <title>Traveling from Vallejo to Melbourne</title>

      <description>Starting Sunday afternoon California time, I took a Lyft from Vallejo to Sacramento airport, where I endured a 5 hour delay in taking off. We made it to Los Angeles, just in time for me to sprint across two terminals and take a shuttle bus to make it for my next leg from LA to Sydney. Delta&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Premium Select&amp;rdquo; was very comfortable with a fairly large TV screen, good food &amp;amp; wine, and quality service from our flight attendants.</description>
