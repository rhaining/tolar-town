      <title>A day in Torquay and a drive to see some animals</title>

      <description>I spent the morning in Torquay with Rob. We had breakfast at Ginger Monkey, where I had a scrumptious mushroom and poached eggs on toast, and we took a tour of the Surf Museum. He went home to work, and I drove down to Anglesea to a golf club where kangaroos live. I then drove further down the Great Ocean Road, which was quite gorgeous. If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t raining, I would have stopped to take some photos.</description>

      <description>I rented (or &amp;ldquo;hired&amp;rdquo;) a car via Oyo, which is like Zipcar, but is somehow related to Toyota (get it, &amp;ldquo;Toyota&amp;rdquo;), and I drove down to Torquay, a beautiful town on the beach about a 90 minute drive from Melbourne. I saw some lovely beaches, some gorgeous rolling hills, had some good food, and experienced some mediocre fast food. Plus I got to hang out with Rob and his family!</description>

      <description>Taylor, Sheena, &amp;amp; I took a walk around the Royal Botanic Gardens in Victoria, which was gorgeous. We had a coffee at the tea room in the middle of the gardens, and later had a delightful lunch a short walk away at Denis the Menace (lol).

      <description>I had a lovely breakfast at Rustica in Fitzroy, followed by a late morning espresso at Aunty Peg&amp;rsquo;s. I walked around a bit in Fitzroy and had a mid-afternoon visit to the Victorian House of Parliament, which was pretty neat. I got to see where Queen Elizabeth sat to open Parliament back in 1954!
I had a delicious dinner of dumplings &amp;amp; chicken at Hutong Dumpling House and a couple of cocktails at Bar Americano and Over Board, which were dope.</description>

      <description>I traveled to Hawthorne via a tram and a train to Taylor&amp;rsquo;s house to visit him, Maki, their child Sheena, and Taylor&amp;rsquo;s mom Brenda. It&amp;rsquo;s been great to catch up, and I loved meeting the baby!

      <description>It was a slow morning due to quite a bit of ongoing rain outside. I did make it out in the morning all the way across the street to the Saturday market to buy a loaf of sourdough and a coffee (which I then had with some eggs I made at home). I finally left the house for a bit this afternoon to get some lunch and check out some shops that were on my list.</description>

      <description>I spent the last few days in Tasmania, but I left my laptop behind, so I&amp;rsquo;ve just posted photos from the trip. Here are the posts I&amp;rsquo;ve just posted:

      <description>I was wiped out from traveling back from Tasmania and doing the walking tour last night, so I laid low around the neighborhood, did some laundry, and ordered in for dinner. (And got this blog updated!)

      <description>For my birthday, Molly gave me a gift of a &amp;ldquo;Drinking History Tour&amp;rdquo; through Fitzroy, where I&amp;rsquo;ve been staying in Melbourne. On the evening of Halloween, I walked down to St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Cathedral to meet up with the tour. We learned some history &amp;amp; drank some drinks! It was pretty fun!

      <description>I walked around Hobart a bit before heading back to Melbourne. Halloween isn&amp;rsquo;t huge in Australia, but I did see a few costumes … maybe?

      <description>I spent a day at the Museum of Old and New Art, known as &amp;ldquo;MONA&amp;rdquo;. It was an incredible experience, starting with a delightful ferry ride from Hobart up to the museum.

      <description>Per Harper&amp;rsquo;s recommendation, I went on the Pennicott Seafood Seduction tour today, where our fearless guides Sam &amp;amp; Hugh took us on a cruise through the waters of Hobart, Tasmania. Not only were they our guides, they were also our captains, fishermen, chefs, and entertainers – their constant prattle &amp;amp; wit back and forth kept the cruise light-hearted and fun. The day was amazing, the food top-notch, and the sights were something to behold.</description>

      <description>I spent a few days in Hobart, Tasmania. This first day, I checked into the fabulous Macq Hotel, met up with Harper&amp;rsquo;s friends Joel &amp;amp; Mustafa, and drank some delicious local gin &amp;amp; whisky.

      <description>I had a wonderful breakfast at Industry Beans of Tea soaked steel cut oats, chia crumble, caramelised ginger foam, compressed watermelon, rosewater gel and fresh fruit. After, I flew to Hobart, Tasmania for a few days, which was awesome.

      <description>I started off the day with a bagel at Mile End Bagels, which was a worthwhile look at what Australian bagels are. This one was good, if not a little off from what I&amp;rsquo;m used to otherwise. I saw a little art walking around Fitzroy and Collingwood, including a Keith Haring original!
I met up with Rob and his family at the Day of the Dead festival at Flagstaff Gardens in the afternoon, before Rob and I headed off onto a walking tour to see all that Melbourne has to offer.</description>

      <description>This morning, I had a scrumptious breakfast sandwich (the &amp;ldquo;Brekkie&amp;rdquo;) at Grace Cafe near my airbnb. Food and drink continue to amaze me in Melbourne in a way I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen so consistently well done across an entire city like this before. The eggs were light and fluffy and folded into a perfectly toasted ciabatta, with chives, cheese, sriracha mayo, onion jam.
I met up with Taylor at Aunty Peg&amp;rsquo;s. We enjoyed a coffee cupping before enjoying some coffees at the bar.</description>

      <description>I had a lunch of &amp;ldquo;Dill-icious&amp;rdquo; pork dumplings and garlic cucumber salad with a homemade lemon iced tea at Shandong Mama Mini. I walked down to the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) International to see the KAWS exhibit, along with a few other things in the permanent collection, before heading to the NGV Ian Potter museum focused on Australian art.
After the walking &amp;amp; the sight-seeing, I treated myself to some cocktails at Eau de Vie in the Central Business District and Black Pearl in Fitzroy.</description>

      <description>Starting Sunday afternoon California time, I took a Lyft from Vallejo to Sacramento airport, where I endured a 5 hour delay in taking off. We made it to Los Angeles, just in time for me to sprint across two terminals and take a shuttle bus to make it for my next leg from LA to Sydney. Delta&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Premium Select&amp;rdquo; was very comfortable with a fairly large TV screen, good food &amp;amp; wine, and quality service from our flight attendants.</description>
