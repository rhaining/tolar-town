      <description>I spent a day at the Museum of Old and New Art, known as &amp;ldquo;MONA&amp;rdquo;. It was an incredible experience, starting with a delightful ferry ride from Hobart up to the museum.

      <description>Per Harper&amp;rsquo;s recommendation, I went on the Pennicott Seafood Seduction tour today, where our fearless guides Sam &amp;amp; Hugh took us on a cruise through the waters of Hobart, Tasmania. Not only were they our guides, they were also our captains, fishermen, chefs, and entertainers – their constant prattle &amp;amp; wit back and forth kept the cruise light-hearted and fun. The day was amazing, the food top-notch, and the sights were something to behold.</description>

      <description>I spent a few days in Hobart, Tasmania. This first day, I checked into the fabulous Macq Hotel, met up with Harper&amp;rsquo;s friends Joel &amp;amp; Mustafa, and drank some delicious local gin &amp;amp; whisky.

      <description>I had a wonderful breakfast at Industry Beans of Tea soaked steel cut oats, chia crumble, caramelised ginger foam, compressed watermelon, rosewater gel and fresh fruit. After, I flew to Hobart, Tasmania for a few days, which was awesome.

      <description>Starting Sunday afternoon California time, I took a Lyft from Vallejo to Sacramento airport, where I endured a 5 hour delay in taking off. We made it to Los Angeles, just in time for me to sprint across two terminals and take a shuttle bus to make it for my next leg from LA to Sydney. Delta&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Premium Select&amp;rdquo; was very comfortable with a fairly large TV screen, good food &amp;amp; wine, and quality service from our flight attendants.</description>

      <description>Today, I had brunch at Momofuku Ssäm Bar with some friends, walked down to Soho to the REI store to buy a new jacket for my travels, and then I walked home across the Williamsburg Bridge.
